# About make 
In software development, Make is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable 
programs and libraries from source code by reading files called Makefiles which specify how 
to derive the target program.
You need a file called a makefile to tell make what to do. Most often, the makefile tells make how to compile and link a program.
The makefile can also tell make how to run miscellaneous commands when explicitly asked (for example, to remove certain files as a clean-up operation).
